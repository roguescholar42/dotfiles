# My Dotfiles

Here is the central repository for all of my Dotfiles and set up scripts.  My goal is to get switching between machines to be as painless as possible. 

## Tools Used

- [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew)
- [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle)

## Installation

Open up a terminal window and copy in this command:

git clone https://github.com/roguescholar42/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

This will download the repository into the new dotfiles directory.
