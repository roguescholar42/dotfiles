# My Dotfiles

Here is the central repository for all of my Dotfiles and set up scripts.  My goal is to get switching between machines to be as painless as possible. 

## Tools Used

- [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew)
- [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle)
- [Mas CLI](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)
- [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup)
- [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

## Installation

Open up a terminal window and copy in this command:

`git clone https://github.com/roguescholar42/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`

This will download the repository into the new dotfiles directory.
